# Wrapped ICP - WICP

Wrapped ICP (WICP) is a wrapped version of the IC's native token, ICP. Each WICP will be backed 1:1 with ICP, meaning that 1 WICP will always have the exact same value as 1 ICP. The only difference is that, unlike ICP, WICP uses the DIP20 fungible token standard that is specifically designed to allow for interoperability between dApps and other tokens.
